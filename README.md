Project Title:-Visual Insight into Road Accident Severity, Trends & Causes (PowerBI)

 🎯Objective
To analyze UK road accident data and uncover patterns based on location, lighting, weather, and road types. The dashboard aims to identify accident-prone areas, understand seasonal and geographic trends, and support public safety initiatives.

📊 Key Insights
Single carriageway roads have the highest accident frequency.

Rural areas show more casualties than urban zones.

Most accidents result in slight injuries, but serious/fatal incidents spike in specific regions and months.

Factors like poor lighting, wet surfaces, and dark rural roads often align with severe accidents.

The dashboard allows comparison across months, road types, and weather conditions.

🛠 Tools Used
